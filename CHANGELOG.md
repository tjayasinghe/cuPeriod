## [1.0.0] — 2026-06-29

First public release.

### Added

- Seven period-search methods, each with an optimized CPU backend and a CUDA GPU backend:
  - **GLS** — generalized (floating-mean) Lomb–Scargle via non-uniform FFT
    (finufft / cufinufft).
  - **BLS** — box least squares, with a multicore `numba` CPU search (`[fast]` extra) and
    a CUDA kernel.
  - **PDM** — phase dispersion minimization (Stellingwerf).
  - **CE** — conditional entropy (Graham et al. 2013).
  - **String-Length** — Dworetsky / Lafler–Kinman.
  - **MHAOV** — multiharmonic analysis of variance (Schwarzenberg-Czerny).
  - **TLS** — transit least squares, a limb-darkened matched filter.
- Single-light-curve entry point `cuperiod.periodogram` and the batch sibling
  `cuperiod.batch_periodograms` (CPU process pool or GPU, resumable Parquet/CSV output).
- Multi-band joint modelling for GLS, BLS, and MHAOV.
- Frictionless inputs: arrays, dicts, pandas/astropy/pyarrow tables, and
  CSV/ECSV/FITS/Parquet files, with case-insensitive, **survey-aware** column
  auto-detection (`ColumnMap` — ASAS-SN, ASAS-3, ATLAS, CRTS/CSS, ZTF, Pan-STARRS, LSST,
  TESS, Kepler, Gaia, MACHO) and domain-aware error pairing, plus automatic
  magnitude/flux handling.
- N-best-period peak finding with alias- and harmonic-aware selection.
- `cuperiod` command-line interface: `run`, `batch`, `methods`, `gpu-info`, `grid-info`.
- Per-method settings models with `CUPERIOD_<METHOD>_<FIELD>` environment overrides, and
  GPU worker auto-sizing.
- Full Sphinx documentation (hosted on Read the Docs) and a reproducible validation +
  benchmark suite under `benchmarks/`.

### Robustness

- Peak selection returns the true peak even when it sits at a frequency-grid edge (a
  signal whose period is comparable to the observing baseline), and never reports a
  non-finite period or NaN-power sample.
- Settings reject transposed frequency / period / duration-fraction bounds at
  construction; the CLI's `--out` JSON is always standard JSON (no `NaN`/`Infinity`).
- GPU kernels opt into larger shared memory where the device allows, and otherwise raise
  a clear error naming the setting to reduce — instead of a raw CUDA driver error.
- Batch sinks are correct across re-runs: a file sink is keyed by `(key, method)`, a
  directory sink refuses a mismatched `chunk_size` on resume, and a CSV sink asked to
  store raw spectra fails loudly rather than dropping the columns.

### Validated

- Every method matches an established reference (astropy `LombScargle` / `BoxLeastSquares`,
  PyAstronomy, and textbook implementations) to floating-point round-off, with CPU↔GPU
  parity, on 72 real ASAS-SN light curves across six variability classes and on confirmed
  Kepler transits.
